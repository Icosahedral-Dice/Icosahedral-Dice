- This is "Icosahedral Dice", an obscure reference to a lesser-known video game.
- I am currently studying economics with no CS background, so keep your expectations low - original and hardcore coding is unlikely to appear under this account, instead, there will be melanges of other people's ingenious codes.
- Sorry for appropriating codes. I am still learning my way around licenses and stuff :(
- Have fun!
