- This is "Icosahedral Dice", an obscure reference to a video game. (EDIT: removed "lesser-known" and added regret to the downfall of DA/UM)
- I am currently studying economics with no CS background, so original and hardcore coding is unlikely to appear under this account, instead, there will be melanges of other people's ingenious codes.
- Sorry for appropriating codes. I am still learning my way around licenses and stuff :(
- Have fun!
